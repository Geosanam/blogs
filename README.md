## What do I do as a GIS person?
It always has been difficult to me on making people understand about what I actually do. I often tell them that the final product with what I do, practising `GIS`, is **maps** or **नक्सा**. I also introduce myself as a Geomatics Engineer, and when I say that I make नक्सा and I am an engineer, I feel as if they will be confused with civil engineering profession where नक्साs are made. This confusion commonly arises with those who are less exposed to engineering professions and can only relate with civil engineering. Computer engineers may also relate with this where they are asked to repair computers. <br>
My work goes through some sorts of geospatial data collection, data cleaning, some sorts of analysis and map preparation using GIS softwares - *ArcGIS* and *QGIS*.
